if you would like to run this code locally then you will need to clone it to your system

once you have done this cd into the project directory and run 'npm install' (you must have Nodejs installed and npm as prerequisites)

if all the modules have installed correctly, run the command 'npm start' or 'node app.js' to run the application on the address "Localhost:8080"
